    "# Social Media Insight Using Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Text-based datasets contain a lot of information, whether they are books, historical documents, social media, e-mail, or any of the other ways we communicate via writing. Extracting features from text-based datasets and using them for classification is a difficult problem. There are, however, some common patterns for text mining. We look at disambiguating terms in social media using the Naive Bayes algorithm, which is a powerful and surprisingly simple algorithm. Naive Bayes takes a few shortcuts to properly compute the probabilities for classification, hence the term naive in the name. It can also be extended to other types of datasets quite easily and doesn't rely on numerical features. The model is a baseline for text mining studies, as the process can work reasonably well for a variety of datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the following topics in this chapter:\n",
    "- Downloading data from social network APIs\n",
    "- Transformers for text\n",
    "- Naive Bayes classifier\n",
    "- Using JSON for saving and loading datasets\n",
    "- The NLTK library for extracting features from text\n",
    "- The F-measure for evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disambiguation\n",
    "\n",
    "Text is often called an **unstructured** format. There is a lot of information there, but it is just there; no headings, no required format, loose syntax and other problems prohibit the easy extraction of information from text. The data is also highly connected, with lots of mentions and cross-references—just not in a format that allows us to easily extract it!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compare the information stored in a book with that stored in a large database to see the difference. In the book, there are characters, themes, places, and lots of information. However, the book needs to be read and, more importantly, interpreted to gain this information. The database sits on your server with column names and data types. All the information is there and the level of interpretation needed is quite low. Information about the data, such as its type or meaning is called **metadata**, and text lacks it. A book also contains some metadata in the form of a table of contents and index but the degree is significantly lower than that of a database. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the problems is the term **disambiguation**. When a person uses the word bank, is this a financial message or an environmental message (such as river bank)? This type of disambiguation is quite easy in many circumstances for humans (although there are still troubles), but much harder for computers to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will look at disambiguating the use of the term Python on Twitter's stream. A message on Twitter is called a tweet and is limited to 140 characters. This means there is little room for context. There isn't much metadata available although hashtags are often used to denote the topic of the tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "When people talk about Python, they could be talking about the following things:\n",
    "- The programming language Python\n",
    "- Monty Python, the classic comedy group\n",
    "- The snake Python\n",
    "- A make of shoe called Python\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be many other things called Python. The aim of our experiment is to take a tweet mentioning Python and determine whether it is talking about the programming language, based only on the content of the tweet."

It can be difficult to compute this, as the sample is a complex interaction between different features, but luckily it is a constant across all classes. Therefore, we don't need to compute it at all. We will see later how to get around this issue.\n",

    "Our training dataset contains two classes with 75 percent of samples belonging to the class 0, and 25 percent belonging to the class 1. The likelihood of the feature values for each class are as follows:\n",

    "For class 1: $[P(D_1=1|C=1),P(D_2=1|C=1),P(D_3=1|C=1),P(D_4|=1C=1)] = [0.7, 0.3, 0.4, 0.9]$\n",
    "\n",
    "These values are to be interpreted as: for feature 1, $D_1$, it is equal to 1 in 30 percent of cases for class 0, i.e. $P(D_1=1|C=0) = .3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now compute the probability that this sample should belong to the class 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(C=0) = 0.75$ which is the probability that the class is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $P(D)$ isn't needed for the Naive Bayes algorithm. Let's take a look at the calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(D|C=0) = P(D_1|C=0)P(D_2|C=0)P(D_3|C=0)P(D_4|C=0) = 0.3\\cdot 0.6 \\cdot 0.6 \\cdot 0.7= 0.0756$\n",

    "Now, we can compute the probability of the data point belonging to this class. An important point to note is that we haven't computed P(D), so this isn't a real probability.

    "We will now create a pipeline that takes a tweet and determines whether it is relevant or not, based only on the content of that tweet. To perform the word extraction, we will be using the NLTK, a library that contains a large number of tools for performing analysis on natural language.\n",

    "1. Transform the original text documents into a dictionary of counts using NLTK's word_tokenize function.\n",

    "First, set up the transformer class. We don't need to fit anything in this class, as this transformer simply extracts the words in the document. Therefore, our fit is an empty function, except that it returns self which is necessary for transformer objects. Our transform is a little more complicated. We want to extract each word from each document and record True if it was discovered. We are only using the binary features here—True if in the document, False otherwise. If we wanted to use the frequency we would set up counting dictionaries, as we have done in several of the past chapters."
