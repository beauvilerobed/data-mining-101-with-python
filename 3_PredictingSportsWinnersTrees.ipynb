    "# Predicting Sports Winners with Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will look at predicting the winner of sports matches using a different type of classification algorithm: decision trees. These algorithms have a number of advantages over other algorithms. One of the main advantages is that they are readable by humans. In this way, decision trees can be used to learn a procedure,\n",
    "which could then be given to a human to perform if needed. Another advantage is that they work with a variety of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be looking at predicting the winner of games of the **National Basketball Association (NBA)**. Matches in the NBA are often close and can be decided in the last minute, making predicting the winner quite difficult. Many sports share this characteristic, whereby the expected winner could be beaten by another team on the right day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various research into predicting the winner suggests that there may be an upper limit to sports outcome prediction accuracy which, depending on the sport, is between 70 percent and 80 percent accuracy. There is a significant amount of research being performed into sports prediction, often through data mining or statistics-based methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collecting the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will be using is the match history data for the NBA for the 2013-2014 season. The website http://Basketball-Reference.com contains a significant number of resources and statistics collected from the NBA and other leagues. To download the dataset, perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2014_games.html in your web browser.\n",
    "2. Choose to get table as csv file\n",
    "3. copy and paste the csv to your data folder and make a note of the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will download a **CSV** (short for **Comma Separated Values**) file containing the\n",
    "results of the 1,230 games in the regular season for the NBA.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV files are simply text files where each line contains a new row and each value is separated by a comma (hence the name). CSV files can be created manually by simply typing into a text editor and saving with a *.csv* extension. They can also be opened in any program that can read text files, but can also be opened in Excel as a spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will load the file with the **pandas** (short for **Python Data Analysis**) library, which is an incredibly useful library for manipulating data. Python also contains a,built-in library called *csv* that supports reading and writing CSV files. However, we will use pandas, which provides more powerful functions that we will use later in the chapter for creating new features."
